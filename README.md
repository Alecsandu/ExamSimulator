# ExamSimulator(AOP - Project)
This is my project for the Advanced object programming course
<br />
## Idea
This program aims to simulate for different exams the grades that the students will get and which students are most likely to cheat from a given examination room

## Details
This program has the following features:
- create different rooms for a given exam
- add students to the examination rooms
- add staff which will be overseeing the examination procedure 
- simulate the outcome of the examination
- save the results of the simulations in a CSV file in order to use the data in other projects
